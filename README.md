# SpudNova UI Components

A React Component Library that aims to shorten my development cycles while also practising consistent front end techniques.

## Usage

```sh
npm i @spudnova-ui/components
```

Add styling to root component/index 

```jsx
import "@spudnova-ui/components/style.css"
```

Components can be imported individually

```jsx
import { Button } from "@spudnova-ui/components"
```
