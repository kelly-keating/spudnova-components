# SpudNova UI

A React Component Library that aims to shorten my development cycles while also practising consistent front end techniques.

## Usage

```sh
npm i spudnova-ui
```

Add styling to root component/index 

```jsx
import "spudnova-ui/style.css"
```

Components can be imported individually

```jsx
import { Button } from "spudnova-ui"
```
