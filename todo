<!-- ----- Testing ----- -->

[ ] Performance (lighthouse, but investigate web vitals)
[ ] WAVE, axe (can be integrated in testing, also cypress - how different?)
[ ] Could stick w GH Actions, but CircleCI or Trav CI instead?
[ ] Cypress for connective testing once bigger sections are up
[ ] Consider if something like storybook would be fun or if we're just snapshotting

<!-- ----- Components ----- -->

[ ] Card
[ ] Flex
[ ] FlexGrid?
[ ] Form
[ ] Input
[ ] Selector
[ ] Submit
[ ] Modal
[ ] Menu (Burger/Expandables)

[ ] Classname builder util
[ ] Storybook accessibility stuff vs just render
[ ] expect(container).toMatchSnapshot(); any use since Chromatic testing?
[ ] Storybook args - can be more fully described, defaults, descriptions, etc
